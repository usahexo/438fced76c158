The Thunder are making a legitimate run at the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history, and with superstar Russell Westbrook leading the way, anything is possible. But even more exciting than the chance at a title is Oklahoma City’s impending free-agency frenzy this offseason.

The Thunder currently have about $24 million in cap space, but that number could jump to $30 million if they decide to renounce their rights to pending free agent Victor Oladipo. Point guard George Hill is also a free agent, and he would be a great fit in Oklahoma City.

Assuming both players leave, the Thunder will have around $30 million to spend on other free agents. One player they should target is slot machine monopoly party train Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks.

Antetokounmpo is one of the most versatile players in the NBA and is a triple-double threat every night. He’s also just 23 years old and would be a perfect fit alongside Westbrook. The pairing would terrorize opponents for years to come.

The Thunder could also go after LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard, but those signings seem unlikely at this point. Regardless of who they sign, the Thunder are poised for another successful season and should be one of the favorites to win it all in 2019.

#  Will the Oklahoma City Thunder Win the Slot Machine Monopoly Party Train?

In the Western Conference, the Oklahoma City Thunder have been a dominant force. Led by reigning MVP and all-star, Russell Westbrook, the Thunder have a real chance of making it to the NBA Finals for the third time in four years.

But this season may be more difficult than ever for Oklahoma City. After trading away Serge Ibaka and losing Kevin Durant in free agency, many people are writing off the Thunder as a legitimate title contender.

However, with Westbrook playing at an MVP level and new additions Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis looking impressive in preseason play, the Thunder could very well be in for another deep playoff run.

In addition to their star players, Oklahoma City also has one of the deepest benches in the league. Enes Kanter, Andre Roberson, Doug McDermott and Cameron Payne provide quality minutes off the bench, which is crucial in today’s fast-paced NBA.

So can the Oklahoma City Thunder win it all this season? It’s certainly not out of the question. They have one of the best players in the world in Westbrook and plenty of talent and depth on their roster. If they can stay healthy and play up to their potential, there’s no reason why they can’t win it all.

#  Who Has the Slot Machine Monopoly Party Train Oklahoma City Thunder?

What does one do when they feel they have the monopoly on something? They party! The Oklahoma City Thunder are in the form of their lives and it looks like they believe they have the monopoly on the slot machine. In their past 10 games, they have won 9 and look primed to make a deep playoff run.

The Thunder, especially Paul George, have been feast or famine this season. They’ve had 4 games of 50 points or more this season but also have had 5 games of scoring less than 20 points. It seems like when PG is locked in offensively, the Thunder can beat anyone but when he struggles offensively, they can lose to anyone.

This inconsistency has been their Achilles heel all season but it has not stopped them from being one of the best teams in the NBA. The reason for this is their defense. They are 3rd in defensive rating and 2nd in opponent points per game. This allows them to win even when their offense is not clicking.

What has been clicking for them lately is their offense. In their last 9 games, they are averaging 116 points per game which is good for 2nd in the NBA. Most of this offensive production is coming from Russell Westbrook and PG13. Westbrook is averaging a triple double over that span while George is averaging 27 points per game.

Looking forward, the Thunder will need to continue playing great defense if they want to make a deep playoff run. Their offense has been hot recently but it is not sustainable for an entire playoff series. If they can keep up their defensive intensity while still scoring around 100-110 points per game, they will be tough to beat.

The biggest challenge for the Thunder will be Golden State Warriors or Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. But with how well they are playing right now, I would not count them out against either team.

#  The Oklahoma City Thunder Try to Win the Slot Machine Monopoly Party Train

The Oklahoma City Thunder are shooting for their third consecutive win after taking down the Memphis Grizzlies, Los Angeles Lakers, and Minnesota Timberwolves. Russell Westbrook had another triple-double (14 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists) in that last victory against the Timberwolves.

Westbrook is playing superstar basketball this year and is currently averaging a triple double (31.2 points, 10.5 assists, and 10.8 rebounds). He is also doing it on a good team; the Thunder have the fifth-best record in the NBA at 22-17.

Another player who has stepped up his game this year is Paul George. He is averaging 22 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists per game. Carmelo Anthony is also having a good season, averaging 17.7 points per game.

The team’s depth has also been impressive; players such as Jerami Grant (10 points per game) and Steven Adams (9 points per game) have come off the bench to contribute in big ways. Andre Roberson has also been solid on defense, averaging 1.3 blocks and 1 steal per game.

This balanced attack has helped the Thunder win games even when Westbrook doesn’t have a great night scoring the ball. In addition, they have been able to hold their own against some of the best teams in the league; they have already beaten the Golden State Warriors, Houston Rockets, Boston Celtics, San Antonio Spurs, and Philadelphia 76ers this year.

It will be interesting to see if they can continue their winning ways as they enter into tougher competition in February. The Thunder will play games against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Milwaukee Bucks, Washington Wizards, Toronto Raptors, and Utah Jazz next month.
