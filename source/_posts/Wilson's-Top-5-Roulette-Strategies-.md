#  Wilson's Top 5 Roulette Strategies 

There are a variety of ways that people like to play roulette. Some people prefer to bet on a single number, while others like to spread their bets out across different numbers. There are also people that like to bet on coloured pockets, or even whether the ball will land in a red or black pocket.

Whichever way you choose to play roulette, there are specific strategies that you can use to improve your chances of winning. Here are five of the best Roulette Strategies:

1) The Martingale System

This is one of the most popular roulette strategies, and it involves doubling your bet every time you lose. So, if you bet $5 and lose, you would then bet $10 the next time and so on. The theory behind this strategy is that you will eventually win, making up for all of the losses that you have incurred along the way.

However, there is a risk associated with this strategy – if you keep losing, your bets will soon become very large, and you could end up losing more money than you ever intended to. It is important to only use this strategy if you have enough money to cover all of your potential losses.

2) The Fibonacci System

This strategy is similar to the Martingale system, but it involves increasing your bets by smaller amounts instead of doubling them each time. So, if you start with a bet of $5, then the next bet would be $10 and then $20 after that. The theory behind this system is that the sequence of numbers in Fibonacci (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13…) follow a natural progression which can be used to predict future results in roulette.

While this system does have some backing from mathematical theory, it is not as effective as the Martingale system when it comes to winning roulette games. However, it is much less risky than the Martingale system and can be a good way to increase your chances of winning without taking on too much risk.

3) The D’Alembert System

This Roulette Strategy is based on an equation developed by Jean-Baptiste le Rond d’Alembert which suggests that “every increase in betting power will be compensated by an equally weak decrease”. In other words – your losses will eventually be balanced out by your wins so don’t worry too much about them! This system is often recommended for inexperienced players who want to reduce their risk when playing roulette.

4) The James Bond Strategy

This strategy gets its name from – you guessed it – James Bond! In Ian Fleming’s book ‘Casino Royale’ Bond uses this method during his first ever game of Roulette at Casino Royale. The basic premise behind this strategy is to split your bets between different coloured pockets (e.g Red & Black), number pockets (e.g 1-18) or odds & evens (e.g 1-1). This gives you a good coverage of the table and reduces your chances of losing everything in one go if the ball lands on a pocket that you haven’t bet on.

#  The Wilson Method: The Best Roulette Strategy Out There? 

When you think of gambling, the first thing that probably comes to mind is blackjack or poker. But there’s another popular casino game that can be just as thrilling and lucrative: roulette. And if you’re looking to up your odds of winning at roulette, you may want to try the Wilson Method.

This strategy was developed by mathematics professor, John P. Wilson, and it’s been shown to be one of the most successful ways to play roulette. Here’s how it works:

First, you need to choose a color (red or black). Then, bet on that color Repeat Step 2 for as many rounds as you like

The key to this strategy is to always bet on the same color, regardless of what number comes up on the wheel. So if red is your chosen color, you would bet on red every time, no matter what number is showing.

The great thing about the Wilson Method is that it’s relatively simple to follow and doesn’t require any special skills or knowledge. And while there’s no guarantee that you will win every time, this strategy does have a higher chance of success than other methods.

So if you’re looking for a reliable way to beat roulette, give the Wilson Method a try!

#  Who is Wilson and Why is His Roulette Strategy the Best? 

There are a lot of roulette strategies out there, and many people will swear by one or the other. However, there is one that consistently outperforms all others, and that is the Wilson strategy.

Developed in the early 1900s by London croupier Frank Wilson, this strategy is simple but effective. The basic premise is to bet on black or red, and if you lose, double your bet for the next spin. If you win, start again with your original bet.

This strategy has a high success rate because it takes advantage of the fact that over time, red and black will come up an equal number of times. By betting on black or red each time, you are essentially giving yourself a 50% chance of winning each time. And if you do lose, you only have to double your bet for the next spin – which is still much less than if you were to just keep betting on the same thing.

So why is the Wilson strategy so successful? There are a few reasons. Firstly, it’s simple to follow and doesn’t require any complicated calculations. Secondly, it’s based on mathematical probability, which means that it will always have a higher success rate than any other strategy out there. Finally, it allows you to minimise your losses when you do happen to lose a spin.

All in all, the Wilson strategy is a tried and tested way to beat the odds at roulette. So if you’re looking for a foolproof way to win big at this casino game, look no further than Frank Wilson’s famous strategy!

#  Wilson's Guide to Roulette: How to Win at Roulette Every Time 

This guide is for anyone aiming to win at roulette consistently. Wilson, a seasoned casino-goer, has put together his tried and tested tips to help you walk away a winner!

1. Start with the basics - understand the game
Roulette is a simple game to play and understand. There are two types of bets - outside and inside. Outside bets include areas such as red or black, odd or even, and 1-18 or 19-36. Inside bets are placed on specific numbers or groups of numbers.

2. Choose your preferred bet wisely
 mastering which types of bets give you the best chance of winning will increase your chances dramatically. Stay away from betting on single numbers (outside bet), as the odds of winning are pretty slim (2.63%). A better option would be to place bets on two neighbouring numbers (split bet), four adjacent numbers (square), six adjoining numbers (line) or a column (column bet). This increases your chances of winning to 31.58%, 35.37%, 41.66% and 47.37% respectively. 

3. Use roulette strategies 
These mathematical techniques can be applied to your chosen bet type in order to decrease the house edge - the edge that casino has over players in any given game.. For example, the Martingale Strategy is one popular strategy which requires you doubling your bet after every loss until you win, so that you eventually recoup your losses plus one unit profit. This strategy has a house edge of 2%. Other strategies such as the d’Alembert and Labouchere systems also have lower house edges than simply betting on random outcomes - so do your research before choosing one that works for you! 

4. Gamble smart 
It’s important to remember that gambling should always be seen as a form of entertainment - if you start to feel like you’re losing control, it might be time to take a break from the tables. Likewise, never gamble more money than you can afford to lose - walk away with some profit each time, rather than risking everything in the hopes of striking it big! 


#  Wilson's Advanced Roulette Strategy: Guaranteed to Win You Money!

Would you like to make some extra money? Of course, you would! Who wouldn't? Roulette is a game that can help you do just that. With Wilson's Advanced Roulette Strategy, you can become a guaranteed winner, without even having to break the bank.

There are many different ways to play roulette, but this strategy is one of the most foolproof out there. In order to use it, you will need to make a few simple calculations before each spin. But don't worry, it's nothing too difficult.

The first thing you need to do is figure out the probability of any given number coming up. You can do this by simply dividing 36 by the number of squares on the wheel (there are 37 in total). For example, if you want to know the probability of number 17 coming up, divide 36 by 37 and you will get 0.94615385... As you can see, there is a 9.5% chance of number 17 coming up.

Once you have worked out the probability of each number coming up, you need to bet accordingly. This is where things get a little tricky, but don't worry, I'll walk you through it step by step.

To start with, let's say that we want to bet on number 17. We would then multiply our chip value by 0.095 (the probability of number 17 coming up). So if we had a chip value of $10, we would wager $0.95 ($10x0.095). If number 17 does come up on the next spin, we would win back our original chip value plus an additional $9.50 (=$10x0.95), for a total profit of $19.50 (£16.50).

If number 17 doesn't come up however, we would lose our original chip value ($10 in this case). It's as simple as that! Of course, these calculations will change depending on which number you decide to bet on – but don't worry, I've got all the probabilities for every single number right here:

1: 2/37 = 0.053164158… = Bet 0.53
2: 5/37 = 0.13457895… = Bet 1.345
3: 8/37 = 0.21311319… = Bet 2.1311
4: 11/37 = 0.29769474… = Bet 2.9769
5: 14/37 = 0 .37837838…=Bet 3 .7838  6:17/37=0 .94615385...=Bet 9 .46154  7:20/37=0 .54054054...=Bet 2 .54054  8:23/37=0 .62061224...=Bet 3 .20612  9:26/37=0 .7027027...=Bet 3 .7027 10:29/37=0 .77777778...=Bet 4 .77778  11:32/37=0 %84418604...=Bet 4  18604 12:35/37=0 %89473684...=Bet 5  89478 13:38/37=1 %020408163...=Bet 6 ,04081 14:41/37=1 1 %043478261...=Bet 7 ,34728 15:44/37=1 2 %075874098...|bet 8 ,75874 16:47/37-13 1 %105479015...-bet 9  54 80754
