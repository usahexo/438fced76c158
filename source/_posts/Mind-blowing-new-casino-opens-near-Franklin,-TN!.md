#  Are you ready for some 4 card poker? 

In 4 card poker, players are dealt four cards face down. They then bet on which hand they think they will have the best ranking at the end of the game. Players can either keep all four cards, discard one or two and receive replacements, or discard all four and receive new cards. The best five-card poker hand out of the player's four cards and the community cards wins the pot.

There are three rounds of betting – preflop, flop, and turn – with a betting round taking place after each card is revealed. The River is the last card to be revealed in a 4 card poker game.

There are numerous variations of 4 card poker available to players, including Mississippi Stud Poker, Four Card Omaha, and Crazy Pineapple Poker. In most variations of 4 card poker, the Ace is high and the 2 is low.

#  Franklin casino 4 card poker: the ultimate in gaming fun!

There’s something about 4 card poker that just makes it so much more fun than the regular 3 card variety. Maybe it’s the extra decision-making opportunity, or the fact that players can form much more powerful hands, but whatever the reason, Franklin casino 4 card poker is a hit with players of all levels of experience.

If you’ve never played 4 card poker before, don’t worry – it’s easy to learn. The basic premise is the same as 3 card poker: you are trying to make the best possible hand using three of your four cards and the dealer’s two cards. In fact, if you know how to play 3 card poker, you’ll have no trouble mastering 4 card poker too.

The difference between the two games comes into play when you are deciding whether or not to fold. In 3 card poker, folding is usually a good idea if you don’t have a pair or better; in 4 card poker, folding is less advisable because there are more opportunities for making strong hands. For this reason, 4 card poker is often described as being “the ultimate in gaming fun!”
