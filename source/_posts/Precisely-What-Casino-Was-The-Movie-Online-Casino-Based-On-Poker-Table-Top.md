#  Precisely What Casino Was The Movie Online Casino Based On Poker Table Top?

A lot of people think that the movie "Casino" was based on the Stardust Resort and Casino, which was located on the Las Vegas Strip. However, that is not actually the case. The Stardust Resort and Casino was used as a shooting location for the movie, but it was not the casino that was actually used as the inspiration for the film.

The casino that was used as the inspiration for "Casino" was actually the Tangiers, which was located in downtown Las Vegas. The Tangiers was eventually closed down by the FBI, and it is now only a memory. However, during its time, it was one of the most popular casinos in town.

Many of the events that took place in "Casino" actually happened at the Tangiers. For example, Sam Rothstein's (played by Robert De Niro) confrontation with Nicky Santoro (played by Joe Pesci) took place at the Tangiers. In addition, Ginger McKenna's (played by Sharon Stone) confrontation with Lester Diamond (played by James Woods) also took place at the casino.

#  Did The Filmmakers Use Actual Slot Machines And Tables In The Film? 

The answer to this question is yes, the filmmakers used actual slot machines and tables in the film. In fact, they even shot some of the scenes in Las Vegas casinos. This helped to create a more realistic and believable setting for the film. 

One of the things that makes this film so great is its accuracy and attention to detail. For example, in one scene we see main character Mark Wahlberg playing a table game against Ben Affleck. The two are actually playing blackjack, and the cards and chips are all handled correctly. 

This level of accuracy was also seen in the scenes that involved slot machines. In one particular scene, we see Wahlberg winning big on a slot machine. The footage for this scene was actually shot at the New York-New York casino in Las Vegas. 

Overall, it's clear that the filmmakers went to great lengths to make sure that every aspect of the film was as accurate as possible. This attention to detail helps to create a more believable and enjoyable experience for viewers.

#  How Close Did They Stick To Reality When Making The Film? 

The new movie "The Martian" is out and has been getting a lot of attention. The story is about an astronaut that becomes stranded on Mars and must find a way to survive. 

There are some people that are questioning how close to reality the filmmakers stayed when making the movie. For example, did they have to change anything about the story or the environment to make it more believable? 

According to director Ridley Scott, they tried to stay as close to reality as possible. However, there were some things that they had to change in order to make it more believable. For example, the landscape on Mars was very different than what was shown in the movie. 

In addition, they had to create a food supply for the astronauts since there is no food on Mars. This was done by growing potatoes in a special greenhouse on Mars. 

Overall, it seems like the filmmakers did a good job of staying close to reality while making this movie.

#  What Real-Life Locations Were Used In The Film? 

A Beautiful Mind is a 2001 American biographical drama film directed by Ron Howard. It was adapted from the 1951 book of the same name by Sylvia Nasar. The film tells the story of John Nash, a mathematician who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and is institutionalized for over 20 years.

Howard has stated that A Beautiful Mind is "not really a biopic", explaining that only 25% of the film is based on Nash's life. The remainder of the film is based on Nash's life as viewed by Nasar, including her own speculations about his mental illness.

The following real-life locations were used in the filming of A Beautiful Mind: 

Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey
John Nash did his undergraduate studies at Princeton University and began working on his graduate degree there before transferring to Harvard University. 

Rockefeller University in Manhattan, New York City
Nash did some of his graduate work at Rockefeller University. 

 Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts
Nash completed his doctoral studies at MIT.  

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Cold Spring Harbor, New York
Nash worked as a research associate at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory for a brief period in 1948.

#  How Much Of The Film Is Fact, And How Much Is Fiction?

The film "The Social Network" tells the story of the founding of Facebook, and is based on the book "The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, A Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius And Betrayal" by Ben Mezrich. It has been met with critical acclaim, and was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

However, the question on many people's minds is how much of the film is fact, and how much is fiction?

Mezrich has said that the film is "93% accurate", but it has been criticized for taking liberties with the true story. For example, in the film Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg) is portrayed as a lone genius who created Facebook single-handedly, while in reality he was part of a team of developers who worked on the site.

Another example is that of Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake), who in real life was not involved in the creation of Facebook but became involved later on. In the film he is portrayed as Zuckerberg's advisor and mentor.

Despite these differences, the film does remain faithful to the main aspects of the story. It shows Zuckerberg's rivalry with Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield), and his relationship with Erica Albright (played by Rooney Mara). It also portrays the lawsuit brought against Zuckerberg by Saverin and others.

So overall, while "The Social Network" may take some liberties with the truth, it remains a fairly accurate portrayal of what happened during the creation of Facebook.
