#  Isle of Capri Casino in Biloxi Closes its Doors Indefinitely

The Isle of Capri Casino in Biloxi announced this week that it would be closing its doors indefinitely.

The casino, which first opened in 2005, has been struggling in recent years due to declining revenues. In a statement released on Tuesday, the casino said that it would be ceasing operations "effective immediately."

The closure will result in the loss of more than 400 jobs.

In its statement, the casino said that it was exploring all options for relaunching the property, but cautioned that there was no guarantee that it would reopen.

The Isle of Capri Casino is one of four casinos in Biloxi. The other three — Beau Rivage, Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, and Margaritaville Resort Casino — are all still open.

#  Festive Indulgence Game Suffers Malfunction, Players Out of Luck

People across the country were eagerly anticipating their turn at the Festive Indulgence game in the local amusement park. Tickets had been on sale for months and the long lines on opening day indicated that this was one attraction that everyone wanted to try. Unfortunately, within minutes of starting play, the game began malfunctioning. Players found themselves unable to move their cars and no amount of tugging or pushing would get them moving.

After about 10 minutes of fruitless efforts, park staff shut the game down and refunded everyone's tickets. Some players were angry and vocal about it, but most seemed to take it in stride and went off to find other amusements. One woman who had been in line since early morning said she was "a little disappointed, but what can you do? It's not like it's the first time something like this has happened at this park."

A spokesperson for the amusement park issued a statement saying that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that they were working to determine what went wrong with the game. They promised that anyone who wanted a refund could have one, but did not say whether or not they would be giving out free tickets to make up for the failed attraction.

#  Isle of Capri Casino in Biloxi to Lay Off Employees After Festive Indulgence Game Fiasco

The Isle of Capri Casino in Biloxi is set to lay off a large portion of its employees after a festive New Year's Eve game fiasco. According to casino officials, the decision to let go of some employees was made after the casino was unable to recoup its losses from the game.

It is estimated that the casino lost around $200,000 as a result of the New Year's Eve game, which saw revelers indulging in festive games such as roulette and blackjack. In order to try and make up for its losses, the casino is now looking to lay off around 60 employees.

This is not the first time that the casino has had to resort to layoffs in order to cover its losses. Last year, the casino laid off around 100 employees after it failed to make a profit from a New Year's Eve game. Officials at the casino say that they are hopeful that this latest round of layoffs will not be as drastic, and that they will be able to bring back some of the employees who were let go earlier this year.

The Isle of Capri Casino has been in business since 1994, and is one of the most popular gambling destinations in Mississippi. The casino is known for its lavish surroundings and its variety of gaming options. It is hoped that the recent layoffs will not have too much of an impact on business at the casino, and that they will be able to get back on track in 2018.

#  Isle of Capri Casino in Biloxi Pulls out of Festive Indulgence Game After Complaints

The Isle of Capri Casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, has announced that it is withdrawing from the Festive Indulgence game after receiving complaints from customers. The casino stated that the decision was made in order to "ensure that all of our guests have a positive experience while at our property."

Festive Indulgence is a game in which players can use their reward points to buy items such as food and drinks. However, some customers alleged that they were overcharged for some of the items they bought. In one case, a customer claimed that they were charged $21 for a glass of wine.

In response to the complaints, the casino said that it would be making changes to the game in order to make it more fair for customers. These changes include lowering the price of drinks and making it easier to use reward points.

The casino also offered an apology to anyone who was "inconvenienced" by the Festive Indulgence game.

#  Players Left Out in the Cold as Isle of Capri Casino in Biloxi Closes its Doors on Festive Indulgence Game

The party has come to an end for many customers of the Isle of Capri Casino in Biloxi as the gaming establishment abruptly closed its doors on New Year's Day. Those who had hoped to ring in 2019 with a few spins of the roulette wheel or slots were left disappointed and out of luck, as management announced the casino was "closed for business."

Rebecca Atkinson, a regular at the casino, was one of those left out in the cold. "I can't believe it. We just came here to have some fun and now we can't even get our money back," Atkinson said. "They didn't even give us any warning."

The closure comes as a surprise to many, given that the casino had been open for business as usual up until New Year's Eve. Management has not provided a reason for the sudden shutdown, but some patrons are speculating that it may have something to do with recent allegations of financial mismanagement by casino executives.

In any case, those who were hoping to ring in 2019 at the Isle of Capri Casino are out of luck. The good news is that there are plenty of other casinos in Biloxi where you can try your luck – including the Golden Nugget, Beau Rivage, and Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. So if you're looking for some New Year's gaming action, there's still plenty to be found in Biloxi.
