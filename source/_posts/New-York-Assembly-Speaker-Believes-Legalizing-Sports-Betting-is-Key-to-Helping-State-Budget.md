#  New York Assembly Speaker Believes Legalizing Sports Betting is Key to Helping State Budget

On Tuesday, New York Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie announced his belief that legalizing sports betting is the key to helping state budget woes.

“If legalized, sports betting could provide a new revenue stream for the state, and we believe it should be part of any meaningful discussion on ways to improve our fiscal situation,” said Heastie in a statement.

The announcement comes as the state is facing a $4 billion budget deficit. New York is one of several states currently considering legalizing sports betting in order to help shore up their budgets.

Although New York legalized online poker and casino games in 2013, sports betting has remained illegal. That could soon change, however, as both the Senate and Assembly have introduced bills this year that would legalize the activity.

Governor Andrew Cuomo has signaled his support for the measure, saying that it could generate up to $300 million annually in revenue for the state.

Legalizing sports betting has been a controversial issue nationally, with opponents arguing that it will lead to increased casino gambling and addiction problems. Supporters argue that it is a victimless crime and will provide much-needed revenue for cash-strapped states.

#  Delaware Becomes the First State to Legislate Sports Betting

The state of Delaware became the first state in the US to legislate sports betting on Monday, after Governor John Carney signed a bill into law that will allow casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting.

"This is something that Delaware wanted and needed, and we're thrilled to be able to offer it," Carney said in a statement.

The law, which was passed unanimously by both the House and Senate, allows casinos and racetracks in Delaware to take bets on NFL games, as well as other professional and collegiate sporting events.

It is expected that the first sportsbooks in Delaware will open by September 1st, in time for the start of the NFL season.

Governor Carney had been a supporter of legalizing sports betting since he was elected last year, and had even introduced his own bill back in February. However, that bill did not include an agreement with the state's three casino operators - Delaware Park, Harrington Raceway & Casino, and Dover Downs Hotel & Casino - who would have been responsible for setting up and running the sportsbooks.

That changed with the passage of House Bill 179 earlier this month, which allowed for a "competitive bidding process" between the casinos and racetracks to see who could provide the best service. The three casinos eventually reached an agreement with Governor Carney to operate the sportsbooks.

#  Nevada Casinos See Increased Revenue Following the Repeal of PASPA

The repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) has led to increased revenue for Nevada casinos. PASPA, which was passed in 1992, prohibited states from sponsoring or endorsing sports betting. The Supreme Court struck down the law on May 14, 2018, allowing states to legalize and regulate sports betting.

Since the repeal, Nevada casinos have reported a surge in revenue from sports betting. In June 2018, the month following the repeal, casino revenue from sports betting was $27 million, an increase of more than $10 million from June 2017. This increase is attributable to both the legalization of sports betting in Nevada and the nationwide trend of increased sports betting activity.

Nevada casinos are not the only beneficiaries of the repeal of PASPA. States that have legalized sports betting are seeing an increase in tax revenue from the activity. In August 2018, New Jersey generated $2.7 million in tax revenue from sports betting, an increase of more than $2 million from August 2017. Delaware also saw a significant increase in tax revenue from sports betting in August 2018, with receipts totaling $220,000, compared to just $9,000 in August 2017.

The repeal of PASPA is a major victory for states’ rights and for consumers who enjoy gambling. It is also a boon for the casino industry, which is seeing increasing revenue from legal sports betting.

#  Predicting the Outcome of Sports Gambling May be Closer to Reality

In a previous article by Forbes, it was discussed how the advancement of AI technology will impact the sports gambling industry. The article cited a study by Juniper Research which found that AI-driven betting advice could increase profits by up to 30%.

This got us thinking; what other ways can AI be used to improve and modernize the sports gambling industry?

One way is through the use of predictive analytics. By using historical data and crunching it through special algorithms, businesses can better assess the odds of an event outcome. This information can then be used to provide customers with more accurate betting advice, or even automate the betting process altogether.

This is not a new concept – in fact, many bookmakers are already using similar methods to inform their odds. However, there is significant potential for AI to further refine this process and provide even more accurate predictions. For example, machine learning could be used to analyze betting patterns and identify any anomaly or trend that might suggest an upcoming upset.

This same technology could also be used to develop detailed player profiles. By understanding each player’s strengths and weaknesses, bookmakers could offer more customized betting advice and increase their profits even further.

It’s clear that AI is going to play a major role in shaping the future of sports gambling. By leveraging advanced technologies like predictive analytics, businesses can gain a competitive edge and provide customers with a more enjoyable experience. So the next time you’re considering placing a bet, keep in mind that artificial intelligence may just hold the key to predicting the winning team

#  Poker Could Soon be Included in Legislation to Legalize Sports Betting

Sports betting is big business and lawmakers in the United States are beginning to realize this. With the recent Supreme Court ruling that struck down a law banning sports betting, individual states are now allowed to legalize the activity. This has led to a flurry of legislative activity with various states looking to get a piece of the action.

One potential avenue for states looking to legalize sports betting is to include it as part of legislation that also legalizes poker. This would allow them to tap into the huge market for online poker as well as sports betting. It is believed that this could generate significant revenue for state governments and it is something that they are likely to pursue in the coming months and years.

There are already a number of states that have legalized online poker, including Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware. These states have seen a significant increase in revenue from online poker since it was legalized. In addition, they have also seen an increase in jobs and tourism. It is likely that similar results would be seen if sports betting were also legalized.

There are some who believe that including poker in legislation that legalizes sports betting could help to further legitimize the game. Poker has long been seen as a game of chance, but by legalizing it along with sports betting, legislators could be sending a signal that poker is a game of skill rather than chance. This could lead to more people being interested in playing the game and could help to grow the industry even more.

The legalization of sports betting is sure to be a contentious issue, but including poker as part of the legislation could help to make it more palatable to lawmakers and the public alike. It will certainly be interesting to see how this plays out in the coming months and years.
