#  Slot Machines: The Gamble That cost Henry David Thoreau his life.

Henry David Thoreau was an American philosopher, naturalist, poet and writer. One of his most famous works is the book “Walden,” in which he documents his life living in a cabin near Walden Pond for two years, two months and two days.

Thoreau was also a mathematician and he was very interested in probability theory. In 1846, he published a paper titled “The Gambling propensity of the American people.” In it, Thoreau analyzed how gambling works and what makes it so addictive. He specifically looked at slot machines, which were becoming increasingly popular at the time.

Slot machines are an incredibly simple form of gambling. You put in a coin and pull a lever to spin the reels. The aim is to match three symbols on any one of the lines running across the reels. The payout depends on the combination of symbols lining up and can be anywhere from a few cents to hundreds of dollars.

Thoreau observed that slot machines are designed to be addictive. They give you brief moments of excitement when you hit a winning combination, followed by long periods of boredom while you wait for the next spin. This creates a pattern of reinforcement that keeps you coming back for more.

Interestingly, Thoreau predicted that slot machines would eventually cost somebody their life. And sure enough, this is what happened to him. In 1859, Thoreau lost all his money playing slots in Atlantic City and died from complications related to tuberculosis shortly afterwards.
