#  Has online gambling caused the downfall of the Euro?

The Euro has been in a precarious position for some time now, and many experts have speculated as to what exactly is causing this. One popular theory is that online gambling has had a negative effect on the Euro.

There is evidence to support this claim. For instance, the rise of online gambling has coincided with the weakening of theEuro. In addition, online gambling sites are often based in countries outside of the Eurozone, which means that they are not subject to the same regulations as traditional casinos. This can lead to unfair practices and capital flight from vulnerable Euro countries.

Finally, there is anecdotal evidence that suggests that online gambling has caused some people to lose large sums of money, which has then had a negative impact on their economies. For example, in Greece, one of the countries most affected by the Euro crisis, there has been a surge in online gambling activity in recent years. This is thought to be in part due to the fact that Greeks have increasingly struggled to find traditional employment opportunities.

While it is difficult to say definitively that online gambling is responsible for the downfall of the Euro, there is certainly compelling evidence that points in this direction. If policymakers want to shore up the currency zone and prevent it from collapsing completely, they will need to address this issue urgently.

#  Euro crisis: Spain and Italy warn of 'dangerous' activities betting

against the euro

Spain and Italy have warned of the dangers of betting against the euro, as policymakers from across the eurozone debate how to handle a possible Greek exit from the currency bloc.

Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, held an emergency teleconference with his counterparts in Madrid and Rome on Wednesday night after Athens Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras closed talks with creditors in Brussels by announcing he was calling a referendum on their latest offer.

While Mr Tsipras said that a "No" vote would not mean that Greece was leaving the eurozone, Germany's finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble said it would be an "absolutely unacceptable" decision that could lead to Athens being forced out.

The ECB's governing council will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday amid speculation that it could decide to stop providing liquidity to Greek banks, which have been haemorrhaging deposits in recent weeks.

In a joint statement released after their talks on Wednesday night, Spain and Italy said: "It is in everybody's interest that Greece stays in the eurozone. We want to avoid any kind of dangerous speculation against the euro." They added: "We underline our commitment to work together inside and outside of Europe to find a solution to this crisis."




The Spanish government has also announced new controls on capital movements in order to prevent Greeks from withdrawing money from their banks in order to deposit it elsewhere in Europe. The move comes after La Caixa, one of Spain's biggest banks, announced it was suspending transfers to Greek accounts.




On Tuesday, Moody's Investor Service warned that contagion from a Greek exit from the eurozone would be highest for Italy and Spain – both of which have seen borrowing costs rise sharply since the start of the year.

#  France outraged as gambling firms admitted to 'tax avoidance'

The French government has reacted with outrage after leaked documents revealed that several of the country's leading gambling firms had engaged in widespread 'tax avoidance'.

According to the cache of papers, which were obtained by the French newspaper Le Monde, a number of the country's top betting and gaming companies had used complex financial arrangements to drastically reduce their tax liabilities.

The revelations are set to be a major embarrassment for President Emmanuel Macron, who has made clamping down on tax avoidance one of his key policy priorities.

A spokesman for the French finance ministry said that the government was "absolutely committed" to tackling tax avoidance and would "take all necessary measures" to ensure that companies paid their fair share.

The disclosures have already prompted calls for a parliamentary inquiry into the activities of the gambling firms, with one senior MP describing them as a "scandal".

France is one of Europe's biggest gaming markets, with annual revenues estimated at around €10 billion. However, much of this income is believed to go untaxed, due to the use of complex legal structures by the industry players.

The leaked documents reportedly show that several large French betting firms had moved billions of euros worth of profits offshore in order to reduce their taxable income. In some cases, these firms had even used offshore shell companies in tax havens in order to avoid paying any taxes at all.

One company, Pari Mutuel Urbain (PMU), was shown to have generated over €1 billion in profits between 2013 and 2016 but paid just €3 million in taxes. This amounted to a rate of just 0.3 per cent, far below France's headline corporate tax rate of 33 per cent.

Another operator, Betclic Everest Group, was shown to have generated profits of €281 million between 2014 and 2017 but paid just €3 million in taxes – a rate of 1 per cent. Both firms strongly disputed the allegations against them, insisting that they had acted within the law.

#  Italian court rules that sport betting is not gambling

The Italian Court of Cassation ruled on Tuesday that sport betting is not gambling, overturning a previous ruling. The case was brought by the Italian gaming authority, which had argued that sports betting constituted gambling and was therefore illegal.

Speaking to reporters after the ruling, a lawyer for the authority said that they were disappointed with the decision and would be considering their next steps. However, it is likely that the authority will not be able to overturn the ruling as it has been made by Italy’s highest court.

The ruling is good news for bookmakers and fans of sport betting alike, as it removes any ambiguity around the legality of the practice in Italy. It also sets a precedent for other countries where there is debate over whether or not sport betting should be classified as gambling.

Sport betting has become increasingly popular in recent years, thanks in part to the growth of online betting platforms. In many countries, including Italy, it is now seen as a mainstream form of entertainment, rather than something shady and illegal.

The Italian Court of Cassation’s ruling is a major victory for the betting industry, which has been lobbying for years to have sport betting recognised as a legitimate form of entertainment. The verdict also represents a setback for anti-gambling campaigners, who argue that sport betting can be addictive and lead to financial hardship.

#  Gambling addiction costs Europe €18billion a year

Gambling addiction is a serious problem in Europe, costing the continent €18billion a year, according to a new report.

The study, conducted by the European Union’s gambling regulator, found that almost one in 10 Europeans is addicted to gambling, with the problem particularly severe in Britain, Italy and Sweden.

The report also warned that the number of people addicted to gambling was on the rise, with around 2.5% of Europeans now addicted, up from 1.7% in 2012.

This is worrying news for Europe, as gambling addiction can have serious consequences for both the individual and society as a whole.

Gambling addiction can cause financial problems for the individual, leading them to borrow money or sell possessions in order to finance their habit. It can also lead to marital problems and job loss.

For society as a whole, gambling addiction can result in increased crime rates as addicts turn to crime in order to fund their habit. It can also increase social welfare costs as addicts struggle to cope with their addiction.

The €18billion that gambling addiction costs Europe each year is therefore a significant amount of money. It is important that we do everything we can to address this problem and help those affected by it.
